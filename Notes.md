Notes

The reflective optical sensor has a working range of 7-12 mm. Mechanical design needs to account for that.

One of the motors is not super responsive, so it rotates a lot slower than the other one. To accomodate for that, I multiplied the speed of the faster one by 0.3 so it was as slow as the other motor.
