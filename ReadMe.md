PIE Mini Project 3 - DC Motor Control

## Objectives
1. Integrate sensing and control with a two-wheeled, mechanical robotic platform (either standard, off-the-shelf or designed by you)
2. Write a closed-loop controller that runs on your Arduino and enables your robot to follow a track consisting of electrical tape laid out on the floor in a loop.
3. Tune your controller or simply change the performance of your robot (without recompiling and reloading code) to enable your robot to complete a lap around the course as quickly as possible.

Make sure to install the Adafruit Motor Shielf V2 library.
